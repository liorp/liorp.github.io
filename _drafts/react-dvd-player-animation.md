A great web app is measured by its easter eggs.  
And what a better easter egg there is than the iconic dvd player animation?

So I started to read about existing, pure vanilla JS implementations and found out about this one:
[bouncing-dvd-logo][bouncing-dvd-logo]

So, starting to react-ify things up:


I used [create-react-library][create-react-library] to streamline the component creation & uploading to npm.

The code is available here: [react-dvd-animation]
