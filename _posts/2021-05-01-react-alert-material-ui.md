excerpt: "Making a theme for react alert"
---

Recently, I decided to design a hackathon from A to Z.

Besides creating the stages themselves (which I will delve into in another blog post, I hope), I couldn't find any open source software to manage the hackathon itself (which will be discussed, you guessed it, in yet another blog post).

I decided to use the amazing library [react-alert][react-alert], which comes with a few built in themes 
for displaying notifications.

I tried to use the [basic template][react-alert-basic-template], but it doesn't have a typing declaration module necessary for Typescript ðŸ¥²<br>
But one of them is named quite promisingly [react-alert-template-mui][react-alert-template-mui]!<br>
... Yet it uses the dialog component from react material-ui, which is quite obtrusive. Behold:
![react-alert-material-ui-obtrusive](/assets/images/2021-05-01-react-alert-material-ui/react-alert-material-ui-obtrusive.gif)

So what's more natural than to create a new material template, and to base it upon snackbars?

I've started with creating a new react app, and installing material-ui and react-alert.
Surprise! 
![react-alert-force](/assets/images/2021-05-01-react-alert-material-ui/react-alert-force.png)
We need to use ```npm i react-alert --force```. Oh well...

ðŸ›  Starting from a similiar code to the dialog component, but with snackbar:
{% highlight react linenos %}
{% raw %}
import React from "react";
import Snackbar from "@material-ui/core/Snackbar";
import Button from "@material-ui/core/Button";
import {AlertComponentPropsWithStyle} from "react-alert";

const AlertSnackbar = ({id, message, options, close, style}: AlertComponentPropsWithStyle) => {
    debugger;
    const {type} = options;

    return (
        <Snackbar
            anchorOrigin={{
                vertical: 'bottom',
                horizontal: 'center',
            }}
            open={true}
            autoHideDuration={6000}
            message={message}
            action={
                <>
                    <Button color="secondary" size="small" onClick={close}>
                        CLOSE
                    </Button>
                </>
            }
        />
    );
};
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Wait! What is a ```debugger``` doing there?  
Well, I wanted to figure out the options I receive in the component,
and being lazy I chose to use a debugger statement; it could be done cleaner with a breakpoint,
or just by looking at the types (yet in this case there's a small discrepancy, since the types
don't mention a position property in options) ðŸ¥¸

So it turns out the component receives its position, timeout and type in options:
![chrome-debugger-options](/assets/images/2021-05-01-react-alert-material-ui/chrome-debugger-options.png)
And from here it's a matter of a few cuts 'n pastes to fine tune our component:
{% highlight react linenos %}
{% raw %}
import React from "react";
import Snackbar from "@material-ui/core/Snackbar";
import {AlertComponentPropsWithStyle} from "react-alert";
import MuiAlert, { AlertProps } from '@material-ui/lab/Alert';

function Alert(props: AlertProps) {
  return <MuiAlert elevation={6} variant="filled" {...props} />;
}

const AlertSnackbar = ({message, options, close, style}: AlertComponentPropsWithStyle) => {
    // @ts-ignore
    const {type, timeout, position} = options;
    const anchorOrigin = {
        vertical: position.split(' ')[0],
        horizontal: position.split(' ')[1]
    };

    return (
        <Snackbar
            anchorOrigin={anchorOrigin}
            open
            autoHideDuration={timeout}
            style={{
                ...style,
                minWidth: '30vw'
            }}
        >
            <Alert onClose={close} severity={type}>
                {message}
            </Alert>
        </Snackbar>
    );
};

export default AlertSnackbar;
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Lo and behold (sped up 2x):
![snackbar-alert](/assets/images/2021-05-01-react-alert-material-ui/snackbar-alert.gif)

A few remarks for this implementation:

- I used `@ts-ignore`. Usually, this is a major warning sign, but I did this in order to bypass some typing definitions.
- The alert itself does not dismiss when a new one appears.
- The animation effect renders twice (resulting in a slight jittery animation), because of hooks change.

The complete code is available [here][react-alert-snackbar-material-ui-example], and the npm package is available [here][react-alert-snackbar-material-ui-npm].

I uploaded the package to npm using [np][np]; note that [you can use][npx-vs-npm] `npx np`.
