Recently I've decided to design a hackathon from A to Z.

Beside from creating the stages themselves (which I will delve into details in another blog post,
I hope), I didn't seem to find any open source software to manage the hackathon itself 
(which will be discussed, you guessed it right, in yet another blog post).


Some deets:<br>
тЪля╕П Frontend: React 17 (Typescript) <br>
тЪля╕П Backend: Django 3.2 & DRF (Python 3.9) <br>
тЪля╕П User auth system (I didn't get to implementing social auth) <br>
<br>
Available here: [hack_a_track][hack_a_track]


ЁЯЪи UPDATE! ЁЯЪи<br>
I did manage to find one lol: [CTFd][ctfd]. <br>
Seems like a much more serious effort than the system I 
made, but what the heck - I've already written one!
