excerpt: Designing a hackathon system
---

Recently, I decided to design a hackathon from A to Z.

Besides creating the stages themselves (which I will delve into in another blog post, I hope), I couldn't find any open source software to manage the hackathon itself (which will be discussed, you guessed it, in yet another blog post).

Some details:

- Frontend: React 17 (Typescript)
- Backend: Django 3.2 & DRF (Python 3.9)
- User auth system (I didn't get to implementing social auth)

ðŸš¨ UPDATE! ðŸš¨<br>
I did eventually find one: [CTFd][ctfd].<br>
It seems like a much more serious effort than my system, but since I'd already written mine, I decided to share it anyway!
