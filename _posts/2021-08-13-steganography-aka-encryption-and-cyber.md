During the development of my hackathon, I read a lot about potential technological challenges, that would be also be fun and educational.  


A really cool concept I stumbled upon is called *steganography* üëæ

Steganography

What is *steganography*?  
I'll just cite a few words from Wikipedia:

> Steganography (/Àåst…õ…°…ôÀàn…í…°r…ôfi/ STEG-…ô-NOG-r…ô-fee) is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words stegan√≥s (œÉœÑŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒΩœåœÇ), meaning "covered or concealed", and -graphia (Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ) meaning "writing".  

This sure sound like a really cool technique for hiding information in challenges.  
Just encrypt your data in an otherwise seemingly innocent file, and - Voil√†! üßë‚Äçüíªüëå A cyber certified riddle.

The Code
---

For me, coding is a really fun way to actually implement a subject that I'm learning, and so I decided to write down some code that does this process.  
After a few struggles with JPEG compression (like, who knew that a lossy compression algorithm meant that the data changes the data?), 
I came up with a decent method of doing steganography in python, using only 2 dependencies - [cryptography][pip-cryptography] and [imageio][pip-imageio].

It comprises of two classes - Encryptor and Decryptor.  
The Encryptor is initialized with a key and then does the encryption of messages inside images. It is based on a format of header that contains
the length of the message, and then the encrypted message itself.  
It also knows to calculate the loss - percentage of how many bits were changed.  
Of course, this can also be implemented by inserting the encrypted message, with null terminator.  

The Decryptor is initialized with a key and then does the decryption of messages inside images.

Uploading to PyPI
---
I built this package with [poetry][poetry] (which turned out to be a very pleasant way of uploading packages to pypi),  
and after a quick registration process on pypi, it is available on [pypi][pip-pysteg]: just run `pip install pysteg`.  

The source code is available [here][git-pysteg].
