## Privacy Policy
I take your privacy very seriously. This short document outlines the types of personal data that is received or collected, and how it may be used.

## Logs
Like many other places on the web, I use logs to answer some important wh questions about traffic flows here. The information includes:

* IP Addresses
* User Agents
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Timestamps
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

*This information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable.*

## Cookies
When you visit this site, some “convenience” cookies are stored on your computer.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers’ websites.

## Google Analytics
I use Google Analytics. If you're already here, I suppose you know why, but just in case you haven't heard of 
Google - it helps me to understand how visitors engage. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors.  
For more information you can read the [Google Analytics Privacy Policy][google-analytics-privacy-policy].

## Google AdSense
I use Google AdSense, since this website ain't gonna pay for itself. The Google AdSense service uses a DoubleClick cookie to serve more relevant ads across the web and limit the number of times that a given ad is shown to you.  
For more information you can read the [Google AdSense Privacy Policy][google-adsense-privacy-policy].
